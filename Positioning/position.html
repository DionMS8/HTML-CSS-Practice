            <p> Toy Story is a 1995 American computer-animated comedy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney 
            Pictures. The first installment in the Toy Story franchise, it was the first entirely computer-animated feature film, as well 
            as the first feature film from Pixar. The film was directed by John Lasseter (in his feature directorial debut), and written by 
            Joss Whedon, Andrew Stanton, Joel Cohen, and Alec Sokolow from a story by Lasseter, Stanton, Pete Docter, and Joe Ranft. The film 
            features music by Randy Newman, was produced by Bonnie Arnold and Ralph Guggenheim, and was executive-produced by Steve Jobs and 
            Edwin Catmull. The film features the voices of Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, Jim Varney, 
            Annie Potts, R. Lee Ermey, John Morris, Laurie Metcalf, and Erik von Detten. Taking place in a world where anthropomorphic toys c
            ome to life when humans are not present, the plot focuses on the relationship between an old-fashioned pull-string cowboy doll 
            named Woody and an astronaut action figure, Buzz Lightyear, as they evolve from rivals competing for the affections of their owner, 
            Andy Davis, to friends who work together to be reunited with Andy after being separated from him. Following the success of their 
            1988 short film Tin Toy, Pixar was approached by Disney to produce a computer-animated feature film told from a small toy's 
            perspective. Lasseter, Stanton, and Docter wrote early story treatments, which were rejected by Disney, who wanted the film's 
            tone to be "edgier". After several disastrous story reels, production was halted and the script was rewritten to better reflect 
            the tone and theme Pixar desired: "toys deeply want children to play with them, and ... this desire drives their hopes, fears, 
            and actions". The studio, then consisting of a relatively small number of employees, produced the film under only minor financial 
            constraints.</p>
